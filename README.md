# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning-based system for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. It uses various algorithms including Isolation Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression to identify potentially fraudulent activities.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.

## Features

- User authentication and registration system
- Secure login functionality
- Dashboard for data visualization
- Multiple machine learning models for fraud detection:
  - Isolation Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
- Statistical analysis of transaction data
- User profile management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Set up MongoDB for user management
4. Run the Flask application

## Usage

1. Register a new account
2. Login with your credentials
3. Upload transaction data for analysis
4. View fraud detection results and statistics
